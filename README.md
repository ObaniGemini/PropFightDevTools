# PropFightDevTools

This repository serves as a ground for modding [PropFight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2881590/PropFight/)

You need to download [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) to access the editor used in modding and for exporting packs.
*The current Godot version we use is 4.3 stable*

**You can't run or export this project with godot, it's just used to edit and export resource packs for the game**

If you want to test your addons, you'll need to run them in-game.
